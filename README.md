**Emoji Moods Tracker App: Simplifying Mood Tracking with a Tap of a Finger**

The Emoji Moods Tracker app was my final project for my Android Development class, which was hands down one of the most enjoyable courses I took during my college experience. With a goal to simplify mood tracking, I envisioned a solution that would eliminate the clutter and complexity found in many of the existing apps on the app store. The result was a sleek and intuitive experience, allowing users to quickly and easily record their mood by selecting a corresponding emoji.

I am immensely proud of the work I put into this project and the final outcome. In just over a month, I was able to bring my vision to life and create a functional app that exceeded my expectations. While I haven't had as much time to work on it since completing the course, I have been dedicating myself to learning Kotlin and my next step is to re-write the codebase using this new language.
