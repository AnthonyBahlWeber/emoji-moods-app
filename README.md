## Emoji Moods Tracker App: Simplifying Mood Tracking with a Tap of a Finger

The Emoji Moods Tracker app, my final project for my Android Development class, was a pinnacle of my college experience. With a mission to revolutionize mood tracking, I aimed to create a user-friendly and straightforward solution that would stand out from the cluttered and complex options available in the app store. The result was a sleek and intuitive app that allowed users to easily and quickly track their moods through a simple emoji selection process.

I am incredibly proud of the hard work and dedication I put into this project, which exceeded all my expectations. In just a matter of weeks, I was able to bring my vision to life and deliver a functional app that was both innovative and visually appealing.

As I continue to grow and develop my skills, I am now focused on re-writing the codebase using Kotlin. Although the app has been published on the Google Play store, it is currently in testing and not yet available to the public. Nevertheless, I am confident that my Emoji Moods Tracker app will be a game changer in the mood tracking industry.
